      "text": "Antacids should be taken when you feel the symptoms of reflux. Usually, this is just after meals or before you go to bed.<br><br>\
        It’s recommended to take antacids as advised by a clinician or as directed in the patient information leaflet that comes with your medication. If you are prescribed any other medication, you should allow a 2-hour window on either side of taking an antacid, as it can affect absorption in the gut.",

      "text": "Antacids generally have no side effects for most people when they are taken in the right way.<br><br>\
        There is a very rare chance of an allergic reaction that occurs in less than 1 in 10,000 patients. If symptoms such as swelling or a rash occur, you should stop taking the medication and consult a clinician.",
